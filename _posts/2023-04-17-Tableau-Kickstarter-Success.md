We are thrilled to announce that our ***Tableau Games*** Kickstarter campaign, which ended on April 17th, was a resounding success! We are deeply grateful for the overwhelming support of our backers, who have made it possible for us to bring ***Tableau Games*** to life and expand its reach within the storytelling community.

This ***Tableau*** Kickstarter featured our inaugural three playsets: **Twilight Road**, **Gate Watch** and **Improv**. With your support, we brought these narrative-driven playsets to life, to allow other players to experience the joy of collaborative storytelling and weaving unforgettable tales together.

As we move forward, we want to keep you informed every step of the way. Here's what's coming up: <!--more--> Our current focus is to fulfill the orders of our Kickstarter backers, ensuring that they receive their playsets as soon as possible. We are working diligently to ensure a smooth and timely delivery of all rewards.

For those who missed our Kickstarter campaign, don't worry! We plan to make all three playsets available to the public via DriveThruCards and Indie Press Revolution by mid-summer. You'll soon have the opportunity to dive into the captivating worlds of Tableau Games and experience the unique and customizable storytelling it offers.
